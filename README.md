# Walmart Sales Forecasting

## Introduction
Sales forecasting helps identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales data, allowing companies to proactively plan for demand fluctuations. This project focuses on predicting Walmart's future sales, aiming to help the company optimize stock levels, revenue projections, and investment decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast). It contains historical sales data from Walmart from 05/02/2010 to 26/10/2012, including various information about Walmart stores and other features. 

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to provide Walmart with accurate sales forecasts that enable the company to respond effectively to market fluctuations. By identifying seasons of unusually high or low sales, Walmart can optimize inventory, maintain revenue projections, and make timely investment choices. Accurate sales forecasts can positively impact stock prices and investor perceptions, while missing projected targets could have adverse effects.
